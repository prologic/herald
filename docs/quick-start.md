This quick start document will walk through what to do when running **Herald** for the first time.

### Experiments

Experiments are equivalent to a MinKNOW experiment; i.e. where you record the information prior to sequencing.

**Herald** uses MinKNOW experiments to group samples.

#### Create an experiment

- Click on the `create experiment` button and fill in the form

| field           | value                                    |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| experiment name | the name of the experiment               |
| kit selection   | the name of the sequencing kit           |
| output location | where the experiment data will be stored |

- Click on the `submit` button on the bottom of the form

A success message should appear and the number of available experiments will have increased.

####Â Samples

Samples are the data type used by **Herald**
