### Use a release

Herald is packaged as a desktop application (using [lorca](https://github.com/zserge/lorca)). Just download a [release]() for your platform.

- note: lorca apps require [Chrome/Chromium](https://www.google.com/chrome/) >= 70 to be installed on your system.

### Building from source

You will need the [Go tool chain](https://golang.org/) (Herald tested with v1.13) to build from source.

The build script will build the app for you, just run the one for your system. E.g., for OSX:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/will-rowe/herald
cd herald
sh build-osx.sh
```
